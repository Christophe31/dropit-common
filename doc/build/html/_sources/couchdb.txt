The CouchDB API
===============

Dropit is powered by a CouchDB documented database. The application is thinked
to be RESTful, and to work in a distributed system. 

CouchDB comes with two important concept you should know about: views_ and 
documents_. Please have a look at them before going further.

Drop it! Documents overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep in mind that with CouchDB infrastructure, you're free to add informations 
to the documents in your own couchdb db copy, but because we need a common base 
to work on, here are the "specification" of our documents.

There's different kinds of documents, to distinguish between document types, 
we uses a `doc_type` field in all documents. Here are the full description of 
them:

Notes
-----

A note is basically a text, related to a set a subjects, named "tags". It has an
author and a title.

Fields
``````
* `Title`: the title of the note
* `Tags` : differents tags about this note
* `Content`: the content text of the note
* `Author`: the author name

Ideally, it's possible to add many other fields to a note. The first example 
that comes to my mind is a file.

Associated views
````````````````
To work with these notes, Dropit! provides a set of views_:
